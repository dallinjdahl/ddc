ddc - digital desk calculator

ddc is meant to be a similar calculator to the venerable dc, but optimized
for digital computations.  As such, it only supports integer operations.
It features 2 stacks, similar to the forth programming language, and
has no registers or string support.  It also has no error checking of
operands (yet?) so it may crash if given improper input.

Defaults:
The default input and output base is hexadecimal, and the initial data
width is 16 bits unsigned.  The maximum bit width is 64 bits, since
that's the underlying type of everything.  The default stack depth for
both stacks is 16, configurable in the source code.

Operators:
q	quit
d	duplicate
p	print
n	print and consume (no whitespace)
o	change output base
i	change input base
k	set width*
r	rotate (swap)
v	over
+	add
-	subtract
*	multiply
^	integer modular exponent
|	bitwise or
`	bitwise xor
&	bitwise and
~	bitwise negate
#	comment to end of line
>	pop to alternate stack
<	push from alternate stack
b	slice*

Width:
The width function allows you to work with signed and unsigned data.
If a positive number is used, the data width is simply extended.  However,
if a negative value is provided, all numbers in both stacks are treated
as signed (2s complement) integers according to the current width,
and sign extended to the absolute value of the provided width.

Slice:
The slice operator allows you to take parts of a value and interpret
them individually.  It expects to find a value on the stack, with 2
bit indices (0 indexed) on top.  It then reduces the value to the bits
contained within the specified indices (inclusive).  For example:

ABCD 4 7bp # yields
C
